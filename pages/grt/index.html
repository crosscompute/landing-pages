<h1>Annual Resilience Benchmarking Report + Open Source Grid Resilience Toolkit</h1>
<h2>Obstacles to Upgrading Grid Resilience</h2>
<h3>Lack of Digital Circuit Maps Prevents Data Driven Analyses</h3>
Rural and municipal utilities lack detailed digital circuit maps of electrical assets, preventing data-driven geospatial and electrical analyses.
<h3>Lack of Regional Cost Data Hinders Resilience Cost Benefit Analysis</h3>
Lack of regional data on operations and maintenance costs makes it hard to justify the upfront cost of a long-term investment such as line undergrounding or a microgrid versus a short-term solution such as a pole replacement or diesel generator.
<h4>Lack of Open Standards Stalls Grid Modernization Proposals</h4>
Although there are many tools available to analyze the grid and its interconnections, these tools are not compatible with each other and hard to modify, making it difficult to integrate models from researchers that evaluate new energy technologies.
<h2>An Open Standards Approach to Upgrading Grid Resilience</h2>
<p>We are looking for utilities that want to receive customized recommendations on specific projects to improve grid resilience in an Annual Resilience Benchmarking Report. Participating utilities can access a Grid Resilience Toolkit. Lineworkers can map assets in the field with the toolkit to digitize a circuit map of their electrical network. Analysts can track data on operations and maintenance costs with the toolkit to help utilities understand how different resilience strategies can affect their long-term costs.</p>

<p>The Grid Resilience Toolkit computes a menu of resilience upgrade options and recommends the best option using the mapped infrastructure and available budget. The toolkit will be open source software structured with a Modular Open Systems Approach so that modules can be added, removed or replaced. Third-party modules must comply with the input and output requirements of each module specification below.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Risk Assessment Module</i> takes a location to compute a risk metric. The first version will tabulate critical loads and hurricane, tornado, flood probabilities.</li>
<li><i>Resilience Assessment Module</i> takes a circuit map of an electricity network to compute a resilience metric. The first version will combine N+M line redundancy, proximity of vegetation to overhead lines and substation elevation.</li>
<li><i>Resilience Strategy Module</i> takes regional cost data and a circuit map to compute resilience strategy tradeoffs. The first version will include options for tree trimming, power line relocation, power line undergrounding, substation elevation and diesel/solar/hydrogen microgrids.</li>
<li><i>Prioritization Valuation Module</i> takes a time horizon, budget and policy to recommend optimal resilience strategies from their levelized cost of electricity.</li>
</ul>
